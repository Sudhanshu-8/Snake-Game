# Snake-Game

The Snake Game is a timeless arcade classic that has been ported to countless platforms. It's a simple yet addictive game where players control a snake that grows longer by eating food, while avoiding obstacles or its own body.

Basic Game Mechanics:

    Snake: The player controls a snake that moves around a grid.
    Food: Scattered throughout the grid are pieces of food.
    Growth: When the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer.
    Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself, a boundary, or an obstacle.

Key Features:

    Movement: The snake can move in different directions (up, down, left, right).
    Food Generation: New food items can be generated randomly.
    Scoring: The player's score can be calculated based on the number of food items eaten.
    Level System: The game can be made more challenging by increasing the speed of the snake or the frequency of food generation.
